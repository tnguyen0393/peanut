Peanuts Application

Vision: Application where two users are able to video call. The application will listen to the speaker's voice and input their language into text. The app will then convert the text to the reciever's language and output it to the reciever in a chat box where they can read it.

For example: User1 is an English speaker and User2 is a Spanish speaker. As User1 is speaking, User2 will hear User1 and see in the text chat the real time translation of what User1 is saying in Spanish. Both users will be able to see the text box and it will be in their languages. They are able to click on the textbox to see what their original text was inputed and what the text translated to.
